A simple cross compiled language implemented with C# and Python as a backend.
The Python code translates the custom syntax to C#, which can then be compiled and run.
See an example program in HelloWorld.mlv2
StartOfCs.mlsupport contains some supporting code added to each program. Written (kind of) in C#.
